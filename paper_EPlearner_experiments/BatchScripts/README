# BatchScripts

This folder contains convenience scripts for launching EP-learner simulation
experiments across a grid of parameters.

It includes:
- `*.sh` shell scripts defining the experimental parameter grids
- `*.sbatch` Slurm batch scripts that execute a single experiment
- `Rout/` for batch stdout/stderr logs
- `old_files/` for deprecated scripts
- `README` (this file)

The batch scripts ultimately call the `experiment_*.R` files located in
`code_for_experiments_and_figures/`.

## Important portability notes (read first)

The `*.sbatch` files are **not portable** as written. They were designed for a
custom Slurm environment and **must be modified** to run elsewhere.

You should expect to change:
- Batch directives (`#SBATCH ...`) to match your scheduler
  (or remove entirely for local execution)
- Module loading commands (e.g. `module load R`)
- All hard-coded paths (e.g. `~/EPlearner/...`, `~/Rlibs2`)
- Output/log paths if your system differs

Think of the `*.sbatch` files as **templates**, not drop-in executables.

By contrast, the `*.sh` files are portable and document **exactly which parameter
combinations were run**.

## Shell scripts (`*.sh`): parameter grids

The shell scripts define the experimental design:
- set R library paths
- loop over parameter grids
- submit one job per configuration

Typical usage pattern:
```bash
sbatch --export=... experiment_*.sbatch
